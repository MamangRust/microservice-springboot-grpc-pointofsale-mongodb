# Production Deployment Runbook

## Scope

Production is deployed only through:

```text
deployments/gitops/argocd/production-root.yaml
  -> deployments/gitops/argocd/production/kustomization.yaml
  -> deployments/gitops/argocd/production/production.yaml
  -> deployments/kubernetes/overlays/production
```

Do not enable the legacy per-service ArgoCD Applications at the same time as
`pos-production`; they target overlapping resources and can fight over
ownership.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes context points to the intended production cluster.
- External Secrets Operator is installed.
- `ClusterSecretStore/pos-secrets` is Ready.
- `Secret/app-secrets` and `Secret/ghcr-pull-secret` can be materialized.
- Metrics Server is installed for HPA.
- GHCR package access is valid for all 22 application images.
- MongoDB (per-context DBs), Kafka, Redis, and storage classes are healthy.

Verify before sync:

```bash
kubectl config current-context
kubectl -n external-secrets get pods
kubectl get clustersecretstore pos-secrets
kubectl -n point-of-sale get secret app-secrets ghcr-pull-secret
kubectl api-resources | grep -E 'externalsecrets|clustersecretstores'
```

## Promote a release

Use the exact SHA produced by CI. Never use `latest` in production:

```bash
./deployments/kubernetes/promote-image.sh "$GITHUB_SHA"
./deployments/kubernetes/validate-production.sh
kubectl kustomize deployments/kubernetes/overlays/production >/tmp/pos-production.yaml
```

Review the rendered diff, then commit the promoted SHA. CI must publish all
22 images for that SHA before ArgoCD is synced.

## Server-side validation and sync

```bash
kubectl apply --server-side --dry-run=server \
  -k deployments/kubernetes/overlays/production
kubectl diff -k deployments/kubernetes/overlays/production
kubectl apply -f deployments/gitops/argocd/production-root.yaml
```

ArgoCD ordering:

1. Infrastructure/common resources.
2. `migrate` PreSync hook, recreated for the promoted image.
3. Application Deployments at sync wave 2.
4. Observability and edge resources.

The migration hook must succeed before the application rollout is considered
healthy. Do not manually delete migration Jobs during a sync.

## Post-deploy verification

```bash
kubectl -n point-of-sale get applications -o wide
kubectl -n point-of-sale get pods -o wide
kubectl -n point-of-sale get events --sort-by=.lastTimestamp | tail -50
kubectl -n point-of-sale get hpa,pdb
kubectl -n point-of-sale rollout status deployment/gateway --timeout=10m
kubectl -n point-of-sale get endpoints gateway
kubectl -n point-of-sale port-forward svc/nginx 8080:80
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
```

Check metrics-server, target health, Kafka consumer lag, MongoDB exporter,
OTel/Jaeger traces, and alert rules before declaring the release healthy.

## Rollback

Rollback is a Git revert or a new promotion to the previous immutable SHA:

```bash
./deployments/kubernetes/promote-image.sh "$PREVIOUS_SHA"
git commit -am "rollback production to $PREVIOUS_SHA"
```

Then allow ArgoCD to reconcile and verify:

```bash
kubectl -n point-of-sale rollout status deployment/gateway --timeout=10m
kubectl -n point-of-sale get pods
```

If the migration is not backward-compatible, stop and restore the database
from the approved backup before rolling application code back.

## Backup and restore gate

Before production go-live, test a MongoDB logical backup (`mongodump`) and restore
(`mongorestore`) into a separate database/cluster. Record the backup timestamp, migration version,
restore duration, and verification query. A successful manifest sync alone is
not proof of disaster-recovery readiness.
